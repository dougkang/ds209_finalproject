As citizens of the United States, it is important for us to be aware of what is
driving our politician's decisions.  One major motivator in politics is money.
Thus, as the average citizen, it is important for us know who or what is supporting 
your politician financially.

Since the turn of the 20th century, two landmark events have quietly but forcefully
changed the United States's campaign financing landscape.  The 2000 Presidential 
Election showed that it was possible to raise large amounts of funds without the 
help of the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  Also, the *SpeechNow.org v. Federal 
Election Commission* ruling saw the rise of Super PACS. These two events have 
completely flipped the way politicians raise money.

We will look at the impact of these two events by looking at the source of these funds: 
the donors.

## Campaign Finance 101

The modern presidential political campaign is almost impossible to personally finance.
The 2008 cycle saw presidential candidates spending $2.4 billion in total.
So, politicians look to a variety of sources for additional financial support:

1. The National Party Committee the candidate is affiliated with (e.g. The Democratic or Republican National Committees)
2. Political Action Committees (e.g Citizens United) an organization that campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or other types of legislation.
3. Individuals (e.g. you)
4. FEC, if the candidate stays under specific spending limits

Special limits on contributions are put in place to ensure that a single person or
entity does not contribute a majority of a candidate's funds.

Below, we can see the amount of donations per source made in each presidential 
cycle and how it changes over time:

Prior to 2000, presidential candidates relied on public funding.  The FEC matched
a candidate's funds if they stuck to certain spending limits.  Candidates
begrudgingly accepted these limits, seeing it as the FEC's matching as a good deal.

In the 2000, GOP frontrunners Steve Forbes and George W. Bush both refused the 
matching funds so that they could blow past the spending limits in order to 
gain an advantage over the other.  The 2000 cycle saw Bush raising over 
$100 million total, a number previously thought impossible.  This arms race
ushered in a new era of campaign finance.

With presidential candidates having to raise more to keep from being left behind,
candidates are looking increasingly to PACs:

PACs *have no limit to individual contributions and spending*.  Wealthy individuals
are using PACs as a loophole to contribute more money to candidates.
