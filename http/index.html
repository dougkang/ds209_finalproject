          <p>As citizens of the United States, it is important for us to be aware of what is
          driving our politician's decisions.  One major motivator in politics is money.
          Thus, as the average citizen, it is important for us know who or what is supporting 
          your politician financially.</p>
          <p>Since the turn of the 20th century, two landmark events have quietly but forcefully
          changed the United States's campaign financing landscape.  The 2000 Presidential 
          Election showed that it was possible to raise large amounts of funds without the 
          help of the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  Also, the <em>SpeechNow.org v. Federal 
          Election Commission</em> ruling saw the rise of Super PACS. These two events have 
          completely flipped the way politicians raise money.</p>
          <p>We will look at the impact of these two events by following the money.</p>

          <p>The modern presidential political campaign is almost impossible to personally finance.
          The 2008 cycle saw presidential candidates spending $2.4 billion in total.
          So, politicians look to a variety of sources for additional financial support:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>The National Party Committee the candidate is affiliated with (e.g. The Democratic or Republican National Committees)</li>
          <li>Political Action Committees (e.g Citizens United) an organization that campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or other types of legislation.</li>
          <li>Individuals (e.g. you)</li>
          <li>FEC, if the candidate stays under specific spending limits</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Special limits on contributions are put in place to ensure that a single person or
          entity does not contribute a majority of a candidate's funds.

          <p>Prior to 2000, presidential candidates relied on public funding.  The FEC matched
          a candidate's funds if they stuck to certain spending limits.  Candidates
          begrudgingly accepted these limits, seeing it as the FEC's matching as a good deal.</p>
          <p>In the 2000, GOP frontrunners Steve Forbes and George W. Bush both refused the 
          matching funds so that they could blow past the spending limits in order to 
          gain an advantage over the other.  The 2000 cycle saw Bush raising over 
          $100 million total, a number previously thought impossible.  This arms race
          ushered in a new era of campaign finance.</p>
