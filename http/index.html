          <p>With the coming 2016 election, it is important for us to be aware of what could be
          driving our future president's decisions.  One major motivator in politics is money.
          Thus, as the average citizen, it is important for us know who or what is supporting 
          your politician financially.</p>
          <p>Since the turn of the 20th century, two landmark events have forcefully
          changed the United States's campaign financing landscape.  The 2000 Presidential 
          Election showed that it was possible to raise large amounts of funds without the 
          help of the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  Also, the <em>Citizens United v. Federal 
          Election Commission</em> ruling saw the rise of Super PACS. These two events have 
        completely flipped where politicians raise money.</p>
          <p>We will look at the impact of these two events by following the money.</p>

          <h2>Campaign Finance 101</h2>
          <p>The modern presidential political campaign is almost impossible to personally finance.
          To put things into perspective, the 2008 cycle saw presidential candidates spending $2.4 billion in total. So, politicians look to a variety of sources for additional financial support:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The <b>National Party Committee</b> the candidate is affiliated with (e.g. The Democratic or Republican National Committees)</li>
            <li><b>Political Action Committees</b> (e.g Citizens United), organizations that campaign for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or other types of legislation.</li>
            <li><b>Individuals</b> (e.g. you)</li>
            <li>The <b>Federal Election Committee</b> (FEC), if the candidate stays under specific spending limits</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To avoid corruption of our officials, special limits on contributions are put in place to ensure that a single person or
          entity does not contribute a majority of a candidate's funds.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>To the right, we can see where donors are sending their money during each presidential cycle and how it changes over time.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Mouse over cycles to compare years in the bar chart below.</li>
            <li>Click on the bars in the bar chart to include or exclude them from the area chart above.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You can see that PAC donations dominate all types of donations. This is because the limit for donating to PACs is much higher than donating directly to the candidate ($30,800 vs. $2,600).  Certain independent expenditure PACs also enjoy no limit on donation amounts.</p>
          <p>We can also observe certain points of inflection, which will be explained in a later
          section marked on the graph.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Prior to 2000, presidential candidates relied heavily on public funding.  
          The FEC matched a candidate's funds if they stuck to certain spending limits.  
          Candidates begrudgingly accepted these limits, seeing the FEC's matching as a good deal.</p>
          <p>In the 2000 election, GOP frontrunners Steve Forbes and George W. Bush both refused the 
          matching funds so that they could blow past the spending limits in order to 
          gain an advantage over the other.  The 2000 cycle saw Bush raising over 
          $70 million, a number previously thought impossible.  The bar was raised,
          and the continued arms race ushered in a new era of campaign finance.</p>

          <p>The close election exposed a loophole where party committees could contribute
          unlimited funds to candidates.  The 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act fixed that 
          and all was well with the world.</p>

          <h2>Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee</h2>
          <p>With the party committee loophole closed and the fight for campaign funds continuing
          to escalate, candidates looked to PACs to augment their warchests.  In the 2008 election,
          candidates used another loophole, using independent expenditure PACs to bypass 
          contribution limits and quickly raise campaign funds.
          </p>
          <p> In 2010, the Supreme Court supported this practice by ruling that the prohibition 
          of all independent expenditures violated the First Amendment.  As long as PACs do not 
          directly contribute to or coordinate with a candidate, they are able to receive and 
          spend unlimited amounts of money.</p>

          <p>In essence, the ruling ensured that wealthy individuals, corporations, and other 
          organizations can sidestep donation limits by creating and contributing to PACs.  
          Since the ruling, PAC spending has skyrocketed.</p>

          <p>Presidential candidates have to raise more to keep from being left behind, but must 
          do so in the same amount time.  While online donating has made it easier than ever for
          candidates to reach the masses, it is more efficient to land the proverbial big fish.
          To overcome contribution limits, candidates are looking increasingly to PACs. </p>
